# Fresh Start - Clean Repository Setup

## Step 1: Delete Current Repository (on GitHub)

1. Go to: https://github.com/ForSaleByDegen/fsbd/settings
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. Click **"Delete this repository"**
4. Type `ForSaleByDegen/fsbd` to confirm
5. Click **"I understand the consequences, delete this repository"**

## Step 2: Create New Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `fsbd` (or any name you prefer)
3. Description: "Anonymous decentralized marketplace on Solana"
4. Choose **Private** (for anonymity)
5. **DO NOT** check any boxes (no README, .gitignore, license)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 3: Clean Local Git History

After creating the new repo, we'll:
1. Remove old git history
2. Create fresh initial commit
3. Push to new repo

## Step 4: Update Git Config (Already Done)

I've updated your git config to:
- Name: `ForSaleByDegen`
- Email: `noreply@forsalebydegen.com`

This will be used for all new commits.

**After you delete the old repo and create a new one, share the new repository URL and I'll help set it up fresh!**
