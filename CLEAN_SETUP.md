# Clean Repository Setup - Ready!

## ✅ What I've Done

1. ✅ Removed old git history
2. ✅ Created fresh git repository
3. ✅ Set author to "ForSaleByDegen" (no personal name)
4. ✅ Created clean initial commit
5. ✅ Set branch to `main`

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `fsbd` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "Anonymous decentralized marketplace on Solana"
4. Choose **Private**
5. **DO NOT** check any boxes
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you a URL like:
```
https://github.com/ForSaleByDegen/NEW_REPO_NAME.git
```

**Share that URL with me** and I'll:
1. Connect the remote
2. Push the clean commit
3. Help you connect Vercel

OR run these commands yourself:

```bash
cd c:\Users\dusti\OneDrive\Desktop\FSBD
git remote add origin https://github.com/ForSaleByDegen/YOUR_NEW_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Update Vercel

1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Disconnect old repo
3. Connect to new repo
4. Deploy!
