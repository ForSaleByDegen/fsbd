# Next Steps - After Pushing to GitHub

## ✅ Step 1: Push Commands (Running Now)

Pushing all commits to `ForSaleByDegen/fsbd` repository.

## Step 2: Verify Vercel Connection

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/fsbds-projects/fsbd-app
2. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
3. Verify it shows: `ForSaleByDegen/fsbd`
4. If it shows a different repo, click **"Disconnect"** and reconnect to `ForSaleByDegen/fsbd`

## Step 3: Trigger New Build

After verifying the connection:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
3. **Uncheck** "Use Existing Build Cache"
4. Click **"Redeploy"**

OR

Vercel should automatically detect the new push and start building.

## Step 4: Monitor Build

Watch the build logs. With the latest fixes:
- ✅ React 18.2.0 installed correctly

- ✅ No router conflicts
- ✅ Should build successfully!

## Step 5: Test Your Live App

Once build succeeds:
1. Get your app URL from Vercel
2. Open in browser
3. Connect Phantom wallet (Devnet)
4. Test features!
