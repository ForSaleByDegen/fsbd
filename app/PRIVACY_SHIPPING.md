# Privacy-Preserving Shipping Addresses

Buyers can keep their home address private by using **General Delivery** or a **PO Box**.

## General Delivery (free)

- **What**: USPS holds mail at a post office for pickup. You pick up with valid ID.
- **Address format**: Name, GENERAL DELIVERY, City, State ZIP
- **Cost**: Free
- **Limitation**: Not all post offices offer General Delivery. Mail held ~30 days.
- **Find locations**: [USPS Post Office Locator](https://tools.usps.com/locations/)

## PO Box

- **What**: Rented mailbox at a post office. You receive mail there and pick it up.
- **Cost**: ~$4–20/month depending on size (paid to USPS)
- **Find & sign up**: [USPS PO Box Finder](https://poboxes.usps.com/findBox.html)

## Flow

1. Buyer sets delivery address on profile (General Delivery, PO Box, or home)
2. When seller ships, they use the buyer's saved address
3. With General Delivery or PO Box, the seller never sees the buyer's home address
