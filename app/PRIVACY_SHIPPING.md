# Privacy-Preserving Shipping Addresses

We do **not** collect or store shipping addresses. Buyers and sellers exchange addresses directly via encrypted chat on the listing page. This keeps us out of the data flow and limits our liability.

Buyers can keep their home address private by using **General Delivery** or a **PO Box**.

## General Delivery (free)

- **What**: USPS holds mail at a post office for pickup. You pick up with valid ID.
- **Address format**: Name, GENERAL DELIVERY, City, State ZIP
- **Cost**: Free
- **Limitation**: Not all post offices offer General Delivery. Mail held ~30 days.
- **Find locations**: [USPS Post Office Locator](https://tools.usps.com/locations/)

## PO Box

- **What**: Rented mailbox at a post office. You receive mail there and pick it up.
- **Cost**: ~$4–20/month depending on size (paid to USPS)
- **Find & sign up**: [USPS PO Box Finder](https://poboxes.usps.com/findBox.html)

## Flow

1. Buyer shares their delivery address with the seller via encrypted chat (we never see or store it)
2. Seller uses that address for shipping
3. With General Delivery or PO Box, the seller never sees the buyer's home address
